### Rethinkdb Installation script on ubuntu

Because i'm to lazzy to remember every command to install rethinkdb on ubuntu server, 
so i made this script, very simple script, only put together all the command for installation in one shell script file ðŸ˜… ðŸ˜…

for use this script :

```
$ cd rethinkdb_ubuntu_installation
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```
